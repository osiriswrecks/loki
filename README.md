This is my sandbox for learning about the fundamentals of computer graphics. Like the Norse god, this repo will shapeshift over time. It's not a project, or a product, or a formal library...it's simply whatever I need it to be as I continue to learn.

All code is based on the concepts I'm learning about on [Scratchapixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/).
